-- Schema Recycling firm

--The firm owns several buy-back centers for collection of recyclable materials. Each of them receives funds to be paid to the recyclables suppliers. Data on funds received is recorded in the table
-- Income_o(point, date, inc)
-- The primary key is (point, date), where point holds the identifier of the buy-back center, and date corresponds to the calendar date the funds were received. The date column doesn’t include the time part, thus, money (inc) arrives no more than once a day for each center. Information on payments to the recyclables suppliers is held in the table
-- Outcome_o(point, date, out)
-- In this table, the primary key (point, date) ensures each buy-back center reports about payments (out) no more than once a day, too.
-- For the case income and expenditure may occur more than once a day, another database schema with tables having a primary key consisting of the single column code is used:
-- Income(code, point, date, inc)
-- Outcome(code, point, date, out)
-- Here, the date column doesn’t include the time part, either.

-- Problem
-- Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out) are registered not more than once a day for each collection point [i.e. the primary key consists of (point, date)], write a query displaying cash flow data (point, date, income, expense).
Use Income_o and Outcome_o tables.

-- Solution
SELECT point, date, SUM(inc) AS income, SUM(out) AS expense
FROM
(
  SELECT point, date, inc, NULL AS out
  FROM Income_o
  UNION ALL
  SELECT point, date, NULL AS inc, out
  FROM Outcome_o
) AS cash_flow
GROUP BY point, date
ORDER BY point, date
